LISP Functions

   (xunload appname [flag])
     __________________________________________________________________

   Unload that SDS application.
     __________________________________________________________________

   LibreCAD instructs the application to release any allocated memory and terminate its operation, subsequently unloading the application and deregistering its commands.

   The optional flag argument is utilized solely in the event of an error during the loading process. The xunload function returns the value of this flag if a failure occurs; if the flag is absent, an error message will be presented instead.

   Should the application you are attempting to xunload not be currently loaded, a notification will be displayed indicating this, and the request will be disregarded.

EXAMPLES
   Code Returns
   (xunload "goodapp") Unloads the application "goodapp".
   (xunload "badapp") Error unloading application:
   Could not find badapp.dll.
   (xunload "badapp" "Uh-oh!") Error loading application:
   Could not find badapp.dll. "Uh-oh!"
   (xunload "badapp") Unloads the application "goodapp".
   Error loading application:
   Could not find badapp.dll
   (xunload "notloaded") Error loading application:
   Could not find notloaded.dll
   Application "notloaded" not loaded
   error: XUNLOAD failed
   (xunload "notloaded") *Cancel*
   "notloaded"
