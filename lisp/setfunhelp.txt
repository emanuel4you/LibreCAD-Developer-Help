   This function associates your user-defined command name with the Help facility. This association guarantees that the appropriate help file and topic are presented when a user seeks assistance regarding that command name. The setfunhelp function returns the string provided as "c:filename" upon success; if unsuccessful, it returns nil.
    1. The c:filename parameter represents your user-defined command; it must include the C: prefix and be formatted as a quoted string.
    2. The helpfile parameter denotes the name of the HLP file, which you are expected to have created specifically for your application.
    3. The topic parameter refers to a specific topic name within the HLP file.
