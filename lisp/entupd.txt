LISP Functions

   (entupd entity-name)
     __________________________________________________________________

   Redraw a entity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This function is responsible for redrawing the entity on the display. When a block attribute or polyline vertex is altered, the block or polyline does not refresh automatically, as recalculating and rendering numerous changes can be time-consuming.

   To address this, you can manually trigger an update of complex entities on the screen once the calculations are complete by utilizing the entupd command. The entity-name associated with an entity within the block or polyline will refresh the entire entity group.

EXAMPLE
   Code                           Meaning
   (setq a (entnext)) Assigns the entity-name to a.
   (entupd a)         Regenerates entity group, which contains a.

NOTE
   You can ensure that all entities on the screen are updated with
   the ([link]command"regen") function.
