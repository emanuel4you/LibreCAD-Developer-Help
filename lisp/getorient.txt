LISP Functions

   (getorient [pt] [prompt])
     __________________________________________________________________

   Request the user to indicate a specific angle.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The output provided by the getorient function is not influenced by the variables ANGDIR and ANGBASE. The reference point is consistently positioned at the zero-radian direction, which is oriented to the right (or east). Angles are measured in a counterclockwise manner. The angles produced by getorient are expressed in radians.

   This function is more suitable for determining absolute angles (orientation) rather than relative angles (amount of rotation).

   It is not permissible to use another LISP expression as a response to a getorient inquiry.

EXAMPLES
   (getorient)
   [pick first point]
   [pick second point] no response
   Second point:
   (getorient '(3.5 2.0))
   [pick point] no response
   (getorient "Real Angle: ")
   [pick first point]
   [pick second point] Real Angle:
   Second point:
   0.3222
   [pick point] Real Angle:
