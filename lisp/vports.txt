   Acquire details regarding this viewport.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This function provides a comprehensive description of all active viewports. The output generated by the vports function is a list that includes the identification number of each viewport, followed by its corresponding coordinates. These coordinates are contingent upon the Tilemode setting:
     * When TileMode = 1, the list comprises the viewports established using the VPorts command, with coordinates indicating the corners of the viewport ranging from (0.0, 0.0) for the lower-left corner to (1.0, 1.0) for the upper-right corner. The corners are represented using paper space coordinates.
     * When TileMode = 0, the list includes the viewports created with the MView command, with corners also described by paper space coordinates.

NOTE
   In model space, the initial viewport number is #2; viewport #1 corresponds to paper space when Tilemode = 0. The current viewport is prioritized at the beginning of the list.
