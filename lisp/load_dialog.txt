   To display a custom dialog box in LibreCAD, it is necessary to load the corresponding dialog box definition file. The filename parameter refers to the name of the DCL file.

   This function will return the ID of the loaded DCL file as a positive integer, or -1 if the DCL file fails to load.

EXAMPLES
   Code Returns
   (load_dialog "basicdcl")
   1
   (load_dialog "junkdcl")
   -1

NOTE
   The sequence for invoking a dialog box is as follows:
    1. load_dialog
    2. [link]new_dialog
    3. [link]action_tile, [link]start_image, [link]start_list, etc. (This includes all necessary dialog box initialization steps, such as linking actions to tiles, creating images, and preparing lists for list boxes).
