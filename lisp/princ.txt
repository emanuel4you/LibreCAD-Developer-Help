LISP Functions

   (princ [expression [file-descriptor]])
     __________________________________________________________________

   Print, taking into account control characters.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This function outputs content either to a file or to the display screen. If a file descriptor is specified, LISP directs the output to a file; if the file descriptor is absent, the output is sent to the Prompt History window.

   When outputting to a file, it is essential that the file has been created beforehand.

   The argument expression denotes the content to be printed. This can encompass any type of expression, not limited to strings. The expression will be printed along with a newline character.

   In contrast to the functions [link]print and [link]prin1, the princ function processes any control characters found within the expression. The following control characters may be utilized within the expression:

   Control Character        Meaning
   \\                \ backslash character
   \"                " quote character
   \e                Escape
   \n                Newline
   \r                Return
   \t                Tab
   \nnn              Octal code nnn

EXAMPLES
   Code Prints Returns
   (princ "\nName:") (new line)
   Name: "\n Name:"

   (setq a "Address: ")
   (princ a) Address: "Address: "
   (princ 'a) A A
   (princ "Telephone: " f) Telephone: (to file f) "Telephone: "

NOTE
   It is important to note that the princ function differs from LISP's other printing functions, such as print and prin1, in that it specifically addresses control characters.
