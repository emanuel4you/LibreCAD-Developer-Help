LISP Functions

   (last list)
     __________________________________________________________________

   Identify the final item in that list.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This function retrieves the last element from a list. The element is returned as a singular item unless the last element itself is a list, as illustrated in the examples below.

EXAMPLES
   Code Returns
   (last '("first" "second" ("third" "fourth"))) ("third" "fourth")

NOTE
   Caution is advised when using this function. For instance, if you require a function to obtain the z-coordinate of a point, there may be instances where the point only includes the x- and y-coordinates. In such cases, your function might inadvertently return the y-coordinate. Therefore, it is often preferable to employ a combination of methods.
