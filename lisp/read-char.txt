LISP Functions

   (read-char [file-descriptor])
     __________________________________________________________________

   Read a single character.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This function is designed to read a single character from either a file or the keyboard. When the read-char function is invoked with a file, it retrieves the character from that file. In the absence of a file descriptor, it defaults to reading from the keyboard.

   The read-char function doesn't actually return the letter, rather it
   returns the ASCII code of that letter. To actually see the letter, you
   must convert the ASCII code using the [link]chr function.

EXAMPLES
   For the following example, assume the file sample.lsp exists, and the
   first line is "C:\Sample\First.txt".

   Code                                Returns
   (setq file (open "sample.lsp" "r"))
   (setq a (chr c))                    "C"

   (read-char)
   [press A] Waits for you to press a key.
