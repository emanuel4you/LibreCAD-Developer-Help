LISP Functions

   (equal statement1 statement2 [tolerance])
     __________________________________________________________________

   Assess whether two statements are identical.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This function evaluates statement1 and statement2. If they are identical, LISP returns a T; otherwise, it returns nil. This applies to the equal function and strings.

EXAMPLES
   Code                 Returns
   (setq y x)
   (equal x y)          T

   The tolerance represents the permissible difference between the two expressions, which is particularly significant when comparing real numbers, as they are prone to rounding errors. In the subsequent example, the two statements may vary by 0.01:

NOTE
   The equal function should not be confused with the = (equal to operator) and eq functions. The = function yields T when two numbers or strings are identical. The equal function yields T when two expressions are equivalent. The eq function yields T when two expressions reference the same symbol.
