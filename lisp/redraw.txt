   (redraw [ename [mode]])
     __________________________________________________________________

   Redraw the viewport or just a single entity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This operation refreshes the complete graphic display or targets a single entity. Any temporary graphics that are currently displayed will be affected.

   If an ename (short for entity name) argument is provided, the appearance of that entity will change based on the specified mode argument:

   Mode Description
   1 Execute a standard redraw.
   2 Remove the entity from the display (reverse redraw).
   3 Execute a highlight redraw (as determined by the system variable HIGHLIGHT).

   When these mode values are input as negative numbers, the function will only impact the primary component of a complex element (such as a block or polyline), leaving the sub-elements unaffected. This function consistently returns nil.

EXAMPLES
   Code Result
