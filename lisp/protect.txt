LISP Functions

   (protect)
     __________________________________________________________________

   Protect the file by encrypting it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This function safeguards LISP code from access by unauthorized individuals. Initially, it duplicates the specified file, creating a backup with the extension ".original." Subsequently, the function encrypts the contents of the original file. The resulting encrypted file is a binary output that begins with the phrase "LibreCAD PROTECTED LISP file" on the first line, followed by the remaining data represented in binary format.

EXAMPLE
   Code              Returns
   (protect "d:/sampleLISP.lsp")
   d:/sampleLISP.lsp .original (not encrypted)
   d:/sampleLISP.lsp (encrypted)

   CAUTION  Keep the copied file with the .orangial file extension. After
   a file is encrypted, there is no way to remove the encryption and read
   the file contents.
