   Temporary vectors are displayed one at a time within the current viewport. These vectors will vanish upon executing any command that refreshes the viewport.

   The argument vector-lists refers to the lists used for rendering vectors, which include starting and ending points along with their respective colors. The points should be provided in pairs, organized into two consecutive point lists:

   '([color] from1 to1
   [color] from2 to2
   ...
   )

   The color component of the vector list must fall within the range of 0 to 255. If the value exceeds 255, the color will be interpreted as XOR ink, which will negate any underlying elements it overlays. Conversely, if the color value is below 0, the vector will be highlighted:

    Color           Meaning
   -1      Highlight ink.
   0 - 255 Standard LibreCAD colors.
   256     XOR ink.

EXAMPLES
   Code                               Returns Draws
   (grvecs '( 2 (1.0 1.0) (3.0 6.0))) nil     2 = Yellow vector.
   (grvecs '( 1 (3.0 6.0) (6.5 10.5)  nil     1 = Red vector.
