LISP Functions

   (read-line [file-descriptor])
     __________________________________________________________________

   Read whole line.
     __________________________________________________________________

   It is typically more practical and efficient to utilize. Any content can be retrieved from a file, as the format is a string. The file is designated by a specific function.

EXAMPLE
   For instance, consider the following example: if the file sample.lsp is present, the first line contains "C:\Sample\First.txt," and the second line reads "Second Line."
   Code                                Returns
   (setq file (open "sample.lsp" "r"))
   (setq c (read-line file))           "C:\\Sample\\First.txt"
   (setq d (read-line file))           "Second Line"

NOTES
     * The read-line function advances to the subsequent line in the file automatically, providing the next line as its output.

     * Upon reaching the end of the file, the read-line function returns nil.
