LISP Functions

   (getangle [point] [prompt])
     __________________________________________________________________

   Request the user to specify an angle.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This function requests the user to input an angle in the format of the current angle units, which is subsequently returned in radians. If a two-dimensional point is provided, the getangle function calculates the angle between the current zero direction, as defined by the ANGBASE variable, and the guiding line; the angle is measured in a counterclockwise direction.

   In converting the provided angle to radians, the getangle function disregards the ANGDIR variable and measures counterclockwise, with zero radians corresponding to the current ANGBASE setting.

   A prompt can be provided to solicit either a point or an angle from the user.

   The user is not permitted to enter an alternative LISP expression in response to the getangle function.

EXAMPLES
   (getangle)
   [pick point] Second point:
   (getangle "Rotation angle: ")
   [pick point] Rotation angle:
   0.25553

   (getangle '(5.0 2.0))
   [pick point] no response
   (getangle '(1.0 3.5) "Rotation angle: ")
   [pick point] Rotation angle:
   1.33221

NOTE
   The getangle function measures the angle from the zero angle as established by the Units command. To measure the angle from the absolute reference, additional considerations are required.
