LISP Functions

   (getdist [point] [prompt])
     __________________________________________________________________

   Request the user to identify two points.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This function requests the user to input a distance or to select one or more numbers, irrespective of the distance format currently set by the Units command. A prompt string can be defined to guide the user in providing input. It is not permissible to enter another LISP expression in response to the getdist function.

EXAMPLES
   The examples in this section illustrate the two methods for utilizing the getdist function.

    1. Two-point method: omit the point argument. The getpoint function will prompt the user for two points. The prompt for the initial point is defined by the prompt; LibreCAD will display "Second point:" for the selection of the second point. A guiding line extends from the first point to the target, assisting visually in selecting the second point.

   Code              Returns
   (getdist)
   [pick first point]
   [pick second point] no prompt
   Second point:
   (getdist "Length of street: ")
   [pick first point]
   [pick second point] Length of street:
   Second point:
   10.5

   2. One-point method: include the point argument. The getpoint function will prompt the user for a single point. The prompt for the subsequent point is defined by the prompt. A guiding line extends from the first point to the target, assisting visually in selecting the second point.

                          Code                   Returns
   [pick point] no prompt
   5.3
   (getdist '(3.0 2.0) "Length of pipe: "))
   [pick point] Length of pipe:
