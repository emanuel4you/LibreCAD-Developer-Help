LISP Functions

   (println [expression [file-descriptor]])
     __________________________________________________________________

   Print, using formatted printing.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The println function automatically inserts a new-line character prior to the expression and appends a space following it. Similar to [link]prin1, the println function interprets control characters literally, meaning it does not execute them.

EXAMPLES
   Code Prints Returns
   Command: (println "Hello world.")
            Hello world.
            Hello world.
            nil

NOTE
   It is important to note that the distinction between the println function and other println-related functions in LISP, such as [link]prin1 and [link]princ, lies in the fact that println inherently adds a new-line character before the expression and a space after it.
