LISP Functions

   (write-char character [file-descriptor])
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write that character to a file.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This function is designed to write a character to a specified file. The characters written are represented in ASCII code. To convert a letter into its ASCII code, one can utilize the (equal statement1 statement2). If the file descriptor is omitted, the character will be output to both the command line and the Prompt History window.

NOTE
   It is important to note that the [link]write-line function, which accepts a string as its format argument, is generally more practical and efficient compared to the write-char function.

EXAMPLE
   Code Returns Prints in File
