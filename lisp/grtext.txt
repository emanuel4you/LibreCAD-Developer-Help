   (grtext [flag text])
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write text on the status line.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This function enables the placement of text in either the status line or the coordinate status area, depending on the specified flag:

   Flag        Meaning
   -1   Status Line
   -2   Coordinate Status Line

   The text must be a string. If the string exceeds the available space, it will be truncated.

   When the coordinate status is activated (with the Coords command set to 1 or 2), any previously entered text in this field will be replaced with new coordinates as soon as the mouse is moved.

   To clear the text from the coordinate status line when COORDS is disabled, or from the status line, you may invoke the grtext function without any parameters.

EXAMPLES
   Code Returns
   (grtext -2 "This is mode -2") This is mode -2
   Places text in coordinate area.
   (grtext) nil
   Clears text from status line
