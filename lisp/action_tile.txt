LISP Functions

   (action_tile key expression)
     __________________________________________________________________

   Respond when the user clicks a dialog box tile.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This function designates the expression to be evaluated upon the selection of a key, which is case-sensitive. Typically, the expression is another LISP function, while the key pertains to the specific tile. This function is applicable to tiles that are selectable by the user within a dialog box, including elements such as radio buttons, check boxes, or buttons.

   The expression references the tile through the following parameters:

   Argument Meaning
   $value   Current value
   $key     Tile name
   $data    Application specific data
   $reason  Callback reason
   $x       Image x-coordinate
   $y       Image y-coordinate

EXAMPLE
   Code                        Returns
   (action_tile "xpt" x_coord) nil

NOTES
     * The expression assigned by action_tile takes precedence over the default action of the dialog box, which is established through the new_dialog function, as well as the tile's action attribute.
     * The command function is not permissible to be invoked by action_tile.
