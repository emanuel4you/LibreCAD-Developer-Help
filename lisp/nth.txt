   (nth integer list)
     __________________________________________________________________

   Determine the nth item in the list.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Identify the nth element within a list. This function proves to be particularly useful for extracting a specific element from lengthy lists.

   The integer argument signifies the position of the element to be extracted. It is important to note that the initial element in the list is indexed as 0; therefore, to access the third element, one should use the index 2. If the integer exceeds the total count of elements in the list (which is effectively the count minus one), the nth function will return nil.

EXAMPLES
   Code                                   Returns
   (setq c '("one" "two" "three" "four")) (one two three four)
   (nth 2 c)                              three
   (nth 5 c)                              nil
