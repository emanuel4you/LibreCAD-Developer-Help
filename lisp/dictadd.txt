LISP Functions

   (dictadd ename symbol newobj)
     __________________________________________________________________

   Add a nongraphical object to a dictionary.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The dictadd function is designed to incorporate an object (newobj) into a dictionary (ename), utilizing the symbol as the key identifier for the object being inserted. It is essential that each symbol represents a distinct name that is not already present in the dictionary. Furthermore, every object included in a dictionary must be unique to that specific dictionary.

EXAMPLEÂ´
   ; Create an entity list
   (setq dictionary (list '(0 . "DICTIONARY") '(100 . "AcDbDictionary")))

   ; Create an entity from entity list
   (setq xname (entmakex dictionary))

   ; Get the named object dictionary
   (setq nmdict (namedobjdict))

   ; Add a record to dictionary table
   (setq newdict (dictadd nmdict "MY_DICTIONARY" xname))

   ; Create an entity list
   (setq datalist (append (list '(0 . "XRECORD") '(100 . "AcDbXrecord"))

   ; Create an entity from entity list
   (setq xname (entmakex datalist))

   ; Add a record and return the entity name of the object added to the dictionary.
   (dictadd newdict "DATA_RECORD" xname)
