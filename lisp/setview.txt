   (setview view-descriptor [vport])
     __________________________________________________________________

   Establish a 3-D viewpoint.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This function modifies the three-dimensional perspective of a designated viewport.

   The view-descriptor parameter does not consist of the straightforward x, y, z coordinates, such as '(1.0 2.0 3.0), which one might anticipate from the Viewpoint command. Instead, it necessitates the view descriptor table as provided by the following:

EXAMPLE
   A straightforward method to generate the viewpoint data is by utilizing the View Save command. The example code below illustrates how to create and retrieve this data.
   Code                                Comments
   (command "view" "s" "asdf")         1. Establish a viewpoint named ASDF.
   (setq vp (tblsearch "VIEW" "asdf")) 2. Retrieve the viewpoint data.
   (setq cv (getvar "cvport"))         3. Obtain the current viewport number.

NOTE
   The vport parameter is an optional integer that indicates the viewport number. In cases where there is only one viewport, this argument is unnecessary; the default value is 2. To ascertain the number of the current viewport, utilize the Cvport system variable, as demonstrated in the example above.
