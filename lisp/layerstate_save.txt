   (layerstate-save layerstatename mask viewport)
     __________________________________________________________________

   Saves a layer state in the current drawing.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The layerstatename parameter is a string that indicates the name of the layer state intended for preservation. The mask parameter is an integer sum that specifies which attributes of the layer state should be reinstated:

   1  Restore the previously saved On or Off status
   2  Restore the previously saved Frozen or Thawed status
   16 Restore the previously saved VPVSDFLT value
   32 Restore the previously saved Color

   The viewport parameter refers to an ename (ads_name) of the viewport from which the VPLAYER setting is to be recorded. If this parameter is nil, the layer state will be saved without the VPLAYER settings.
The function returns T if the save operation is successful; otherwise, it returns nil.
