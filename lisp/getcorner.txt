LISP Functions

   (getcorner point [prompt])
     __________________________________________________________________

   Request the user to identify the second corner of a rectangle.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This function requests the user to select the second corner of a rectangle. The initial corner argument (point) is mandatory; the rectangle is constructed from that point as the user moves the cursor across the display. Frequently, this point is derived from a different function.

   The request is optional; it can be utilized to ask the user for the corner point. Another LISP expression cannot be employed in response to this request.



EXAMPLES
   Code                   Returns

   [pick point] Select corner:

NOTE
   The reference point is determined by the existing UCS. Any z-coordinate provided will be disregarded, and the current elevation will be utilized instead.
