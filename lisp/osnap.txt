   (osnap point mode)
     __________________________________________________________________

   Identify the three-dimensional coordinates of an entity snap.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This function utilizes the entity snap modes available in LibreCAD to locate a specific point. You can indicate the desired entity snap mode through the mode argument, and it is possible to assign multiple modes at the same time.

   Mode  Meaning
   "nea" NEArest
   "end" ENDpoint
   "mid" MIDpoint
   "cen" CENter
   "per" PERpendicular
   "tan" TANgent
   "qua" QUAdrant
   "ins" INSertion
   "po"  POint
   "int" INTersection (3D intersection)
   "pla" PLAnview (2D intersection)
   "vis" VISible (apparent intersection)
   "off" Off

   By employing the point argument, you designate a specific point in proximity to the entity where the snap connection is established. In the absence of a point that meets the mode requirements, the function will yield a nil result.

EXAMPLES
   Code                          Returns
   (osnap '(1 5) "center")       (5.0 5.0 0.0)
   (osnap p1 "midp,endp,center") (2.5 3.0 0.0)

NOTE
   It is important to note that the permissible distance between the initial point and the entity is governed by the system variable APERTURE, which can vary from 1 to 50 pixels.
