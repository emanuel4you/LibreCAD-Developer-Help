     __________________________________________________________________

   This function displays the Color dialog box with the Index Color, True
   Color, and Color Books tabs. This function returns the color that the
   user selects from the dialog box or nil when the user clicks the Cancel
   button.

   The color-number argument lets you provide a default color that is
   selected when the dialog box opens.
     * Type 62 long value = A color index in the range 0 - 256. The Color
       Index tab is current. Note that when defcol is 0, the default is
       BYBLOCK; when defcol is 256, the default is BYLAYER.
       Color tab is current.
       The Color Books tab is current.

   When flag is nil, the dialog box disables the BYBLOCK and BYLAYER
   buttons.

   The function returns the color that was selected by the user in list
   form containing dotted pairs:
     * Color index Only one dotted pair is present: a 62 group code type,
       which is the selected index color.
     * True color Two dotted pairs are present. The last dotted pair is a
       first dotted pair is the closest matching index color.
     * Color book color Three dotted pairs are present. The last dotted
       color. The second dotted pair is the corresponding true color and
       the first dotted pair is the closest matching index color.

EXAMPLES
   The following example opens the dialog box with the color red as the
   default.

   When the user selects a different color, that value will be assigned to
   the variable selectedColor:

   (setq selectedColor (acad_truecolordlg '(62 . 1))

   To get the value of the return:

   (cdr (car selectedColor))
