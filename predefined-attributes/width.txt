DCL Attributes

   width = number;
     __________________________________________________________________

   Specify the width of a tile.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This attribute defines the minimum width of a tile. The program will automatically adjust the width unless it is specified by the [link]fixed_width attribute.

   Typically, the width attribute should be applied to image and [link]image_button tiles. For other types of tiles, it is advisable to refrain from using this attribute unless it is necessary to enhance the visual appeal of the dialog box.

   number: any [link]real number or [link]integer measured in units of character width. The "character width unit" is the lessor of either:

     * the width of the screen divided by 80
     * or the average width of all uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z)

EXAMPLE
   width = 10;

NOTE
   The [link]aspect_ratio attribute should be utilized in conjunction with either the [link]height or [link]width attribute. It is advisable not to employ the aspect_ratio attribute when both height and width are specified.
