DCL Attributes

   height = number;
     __________________________________________________________________

   Define the height of a tile.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This attribute specifies the minimum height of a tile, unless a fixed height is established by a fixed_xxx attribute, such as fixed_height. Typically, this attribute is not necessary unless there is a desire to enhance the visual appeal of the dialog box.

   number: a real number or an integer that indicates the height in terms of character height units, which represents the maximum height of a line of screen characters, including the spacing between lines.

EXAMPLE
   height = 10.0;

NOTE
   It is important to note that the [link]aspect_ratio attribute is applicable in conjunction with either the height or [link]width attribute. The aspect_ratio attribute should not be utilized when both height and width are specified.
