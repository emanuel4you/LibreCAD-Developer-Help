     __________________________________________________________________

   This attribute defines the increment value of a slider when the user clicks on its central section. The default increment is set to one-tenth of the total range, which is determined by the minimum value (as indicated by the [link]min_value attribute) and the maximum value (as indicated by the [link]max_value attribute.).

   For integer values, please provide an integer that falls within the range established by min_value and max_value.

EXAMPLE
   min_value = -16;
   max_value = 16;
   small_increment = 1;
   big_increment = 10;

NOTE
     * The default value of min_value is 0; the minimum value is -2,147,483,648. The default value of max_value is 10,000; the maximum value is 2,147,483,647.
     * Horizontal sliders increase in value from left to right; vertical sliders increase value from top to bottom.
