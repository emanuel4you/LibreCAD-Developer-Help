About Predefined Attributes
      _____________________________________________________
   Within the program's DCL, there exists a variety of predefined attributes designated for dcl-tiles. These attributes are characterized by three distinct types of values: numeric, strings, and constants. The valid attributes associated with each tile may vary.
     _____________________________________________________
Numeric Values
   Numeric values are integers and/or real numbers, depending on the attribute. A real number between -1 and 1 must have a leading zero, such as 0.1 and not .1.

EXAMPLES
   max_value = 16;
   aspect_ratio = 0.0;

Strings
   A string consists of alphanumeric characters within a pair of quotation marks ("text") and is case sensitive.

EXAMPLES
   key = "R2";

   action = "(function)";

   You can use the following control characters within strings:
   Control Character Meaning
   \"                Quotation mark. (embedded)
   \\                Backslash.
   \n                New-line (carriage return).
   \t                Tab.

Reserved Values
   Text is employed without quotation marks in some instances. This text consists of constant values, including flags (true and false), names of colors, and positional references, such as left and top.

EXAMPLES
   allow_accept = true;

   color = blue;

   alignment = centered;
