DCL Attributes

   action = "(function)";
     __________________________________________________________________

   Execute this LISP function.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This attribute serves as a callback that triggers a LISP function when the user interacts with a specific tile.

   For string input, indicate the name of the LISP function.

EXAMPLE
   action = "(function)";

NOTE
     * It is important to recognize that the tile action, referred to as a callback function, is typically defined by the controlling program through the action_tile function. If an action is established by the calling program, the action specified in DCL will be disregarded.
     * The action attribute is also capable of invoking a Python function.
     * A tile can only have one action assigned to it, and if action_tile is assigned by the program, it takes precedence over any other action.
