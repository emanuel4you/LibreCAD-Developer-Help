DCL Attributes

   aspect_ratio = real;
     __________________________________________________________________

   Specify an image's aspect ratio.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This attribute defines the proportion of an image's width in relation to its height. A frequently used aspect ratio is 1.33, corresponding to a width of 4 and a height of 3.

   To produce images with the appropriate aspect ratio, one should establish a paperspace viewport measuring 1.333 units in width and 1 unit in height, subsequently scaling as needed. Transition to modelspace to accurately center the image by utilizing Pan and Zoom, and then create a slide.

   For the real parameter, please specify a real number. When the value is set to 0.0, the image tile will expand to match the image size. The default setting is (none).

EXAMPLE
   aspect_ratio = 0.0;

NOTE
   It is important to note that slide libraries are not supported. The aspect_ratio attribute is used with the [link]height or [link]width attribute. You do not use the aspect_ratio attribute when you use both height and width.

Valid Tiles
   [link]image
   [link]image_button
