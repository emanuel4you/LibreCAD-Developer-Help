   bit is an integer.

   A bit-coded system that regulates specific types of user input. The bits can be combined in various ways to create a value ranging from 0 to 255. In the absence of a bits argument, a default value of zero (indicating no restrictions) is assumed. The bit values are defined as follows:

   1 (bit 0) -- Restricts the user from responding to the request by simply pressing Enter.

   2 (bit 1) -- Restricts the user from responding to the request by entering a zero.

   4 (bit 2) -- Restricts the user from responding to the request by entering a negative number.

   8 (bit 3) -- Permits the user to input a point beyond the current drawing boundaries. This condition is applicable to the subsequent user-input function, regardless of the current setting of the LIMCHECK system variable.

   16 (bit 4) -- (Currently not in use.)

   32 (bit 5) -- Utilizes dashed lines when creating a rubber-band line or box. For functions that allow the user to specify a point by selecting a location within the drawing area, this bit value results in a dashed rubber-band line or box instead of a solid one. (Certain display drivers may use a distinct color in place of dashed lines.) If the LibreCAD POPUPS system variable is set to 0, this bit is disregarded by LibreCAD.

   64 (bit 6) -- Disallows the input of a Z coordinate in the getdist function, enabling an application to ensure that this function returns a 2D distance.

   128 (bit 7) -- Permits arbitrary input as if it were a keyword, while still respecting any other control bits and specified keywords. This bit takes precedence over bit 0; if both bits 7 and 0 are activated and the user presses Enter, a null string will be returned.

   256 (bit 8) -- Grants precedence to direct distance input over arbitrary input. For external applications, arbitrary input is prioritized over direct distance input by default. Activate this bit if you want to compel LibreCAD to treat user input as direct distance input. It is important to note that valid point input from the keyboard always takes precedence over both direct distance and arbitrary input.

   512 (bit 9) -- When activated prior to a call to getpoint or getcorner, a temporary User Coordinate System (UCS) will be established when the cursor is active.
